# ReverseGPT ◀️🤖
Ever wondered what it feels like to be ChatGPT? Well, now you can with ReverseGPT! Rather than traditional ChatGPT (boo, hiss!), ReverseGPT asks <b>you</b> the questions! And not just any old questions; extestential-crisis causing questions!

## Why?
ReverseGPT was built very hastily @ Hack Club's [Outernet Hackathon](https://outernet.hackclub.com)! 🏕️✨
